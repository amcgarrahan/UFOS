# UFOS

### Overview
Danaâ€™s webpage is functional but in order to give a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, filters for multiple criteria must be created. Users will be able to use all the filters simultaneously to search the data. In addition to the date, filters will be added for the city, state, country, and shape. This will allow the user to be more specific in their search.




### Results
By adding additional parameters to the filters, a user would be able to find a specific sighting in the data set. 
A user would start by entering the information they know about the sighting into the labeled text boxes, and as the data is entered, the information is automatically filtered to display only the data that fits the criteria in the space on the right of the webpage.

This search is conducted specifcally for a sighting in the united states in Round rock, on 1/10/2010.



### Summary

A drawback to this webpage is you have to clear the text boxes manually in order to restart your search. This can be time consuming and annoying to the user.
A recommendation to the page would be to add a "Clear text" button at the bottom, or maybe "Restart Search".
